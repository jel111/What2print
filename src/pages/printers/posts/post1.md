# My favorite 3d printer of all time!

Owning ten 3D printers is both exhilarating and challenging, but I wouldn’t have it any other way. As someone deeply invested in the world of 3D printing, I’ve experimented with different models and brands, learning their quirks and capabilities. My all-time favorite, though, has been the Ender 3 Pro. Even with a growing collection of more advanced and faster machines, the Ender 3 Pro continues to be the workhorse of my setup. I actually have two of these units because they’ve consistently delivered reliable performance for my projects. There’s something about their balance of accessibility, ease of modification, and affordability that’s tough to beat.

## Tech never sleeps

Of course, technology never stands still. Recently, I added the Bambu Labs P1S to my lineup. This machine is packed with features that make printing both enjoyable and efficient. The print speed is astounding, and it has several smart capabilities that I wish were available on older models like the Ender 3 Pro. The P1S is quickly becoming my go-to printer when I need a high-quality print done fast. It has particularly impressed me with its precision and multi-material capability, which opens up a whole new world of possibilities. However, despite its impressive capabilities, it still hasn’t quite taken the top spot in my heart from the Ender 3 Pro.

## Special place in my heart

The Ender 3 Pro holds a special place because of its open-source nature and community support. With a few upgrades, such as an all-metal hotend or better bed leveling solutions, it can compete with more advanced models in terms of print quality. For me, it’s not just about the end result but also the process of getting there. The Ender 3 Pro allows me to tinker, modify, and really learn the mechanics behind 3D printing. Every time I make a successful print or a meaningful upgrade, it feels like a victory.

## Bambu Labs is coming for you

On the other hand, the Bambu Labs P1S is undeniably convenient. It’s a powerful machine that works right out of the box, which is a huge plus, especially for beginners or those looking for a plug-and-play experience. I can see why it’s quickly becoming a fan favorite in the 3D printing community. There’s a lot less tweaking involved, and it reliably produces impressive prints. It’s perfect for days when I just want to set up a print and get high-quality results without extra steps.

In the end, having both types of printers offers the best of both worlds. My Ender 3 Pros are here to stay as reliable, modifiable machines that teach me new things about printing, while the Bambu Labs P1S delivers cutting-edge performance when I need efficiency. As 3D printing technology continues to evolve, I’m excited to see where these machines will take my projects next. Whether you’re a tinkerer or someone who values precision and speed, there’s a printer out there that’s perfect for you.
