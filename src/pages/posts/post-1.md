# My First Blog Post

Published on: 2024-22-02

Hello everyone being this is my first post I thought I would tell you my favorite printer right off the bat. It may not be what you think..

## Reasons why it's my Fav!

The main reason why I think it is my fav is because of nostalgia. It was my first ever printer that I got consistently good prints from and I still have it. I of course have upgraded it but not that much in the scheme of things and the length of time I have had it. It is at least 5 years now. a long time in a cheap printers life. The printer only cost me $200 and that was 5 years ago so it wasn't old tech at the time.

## What is it!!

I won't keep you hanging any longer it is an Ender 3 Pro. Yes you read that right and yes I know all the bad things you have read about these printers. I have run across at least 40 of these in the wild and 90% of them have been solid printers after I tune or properly set them up. In other words when I fix them most of the time it is the owner not properly setting the printer up square and/or leveling the bed correctly. If the printer is not square you can't level the bed. If the owner didn't tinker too bad there won't be replacement parts needed. 
One uograde I instantly do is the red extruder/spring kit sold on Amazon for $20 bucks. This kit comes with an aluminum extruder and leveling knobs plus the stiffner springs and a Capricorn blue PTFE tube. Those minor upgrades and most of these Enders are rock solid. I know that there are a few dogs with terrible beds and chinese crap parts but it's part of the deal and as I have said it's not that many. I stated 90% but I was being conservative I bet it's more like 96% or 97%.
At any rate that's my fav and I'm sticking to it for now! I may see another fav fast approaching. Maybe we'll talk about that next week! Until then folks have a great week and keep melting that plastic!
